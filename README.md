# Aquila-Klipper
Voxelab Aquila with G32 processor. Instructions for flashing firmware can be found here [https://docs.jamesliang.ca/2021/2021-08-17/](https://docs.jamesliang.ca/3dprinting/2021-08-17).

The printer configuration is modified with my PID tune, BL-Touch, XYZ-offsets, Rotation Distance, and Bed Mesh.

The upgrades I've done to my printer are:
- Silicone spacers
- Capricorn tube
- 3D Touch
- PEI Sheet
- Trianglelab 0.8mm Nozzle

Configuration will need to be modified depending on upgrades.
